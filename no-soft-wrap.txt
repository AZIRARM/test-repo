Hi, I'm having a relatively simple issue that I'm hoping has a relatively simple fix. I'm using a repo to post and store plaintext writing (.txt) and I want the lines to wrap in the public preview on github but I can't figure out how to do this. When I go to to edit the file the option is there to toggle soft wrap and that's exactly how I want it to look. I know that if I use markdown I can fix this, but I like writing in plain txt
